This option also allows to open the target page in a new tab, for this just replace the line `window.location = url` with :\n\n\n\n```\nwindow.open(url, '_blank');\n\n```\n\n\nOr, by adding a [`dcc.Location()`](https:\/\/dash.plotly.com\/dash-core-components\/location) component in the layout, you can then update its `href` property using a basic callback :\n\n\n\n```\napp.layout = html.Div(children=[\n    dcc.Location(id='location'),\n    html.H1(children='Plot'),\n    dcc.Graph(id='example-graph', figure=plot()),\n    html.Div(id='dummy-div')\n])\n\n@app.callback(Output('location', 'href'),\n              Input('example-graph', 'clickData'),\n              prevent_initial_call=True)\ndef redirect_to_url(clickData):\n    # do something with clickData\n    url = 'https:www.example.com'\n    return url\n\n```\n\nA few things to note :\n\n\n* You don't need to check the trigger id if you have only one `Input()` (ie. the condition `if triggered_id=='graph'` is not necessary)\n* Ensure your Input\/Output ids match what you have in the layout ('graph' vs 'example-graph')\n* Redirecting the user \"*whenever a particular data point is clicked*\" implies the condition `clickData is not None` instead of `clickData is None`\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[Share](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/a\/75733381 \"Short permalink to this answer\")\n\n\n[Improve this answer](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/posts\/75733381\/edit)\n\n\n\n Follow\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[edited Mar 16, 2023 at 14:32](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/posts\/75733381\/revisions \"show all edits to this post\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n answered Mar 14, 2023 at 12:51\n\n\n\n\n\n\n[EricLavault](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/users\/2529954\/ericlavault)EricLavault\n\n13.5k33 gold badges2424 silver badges4949 bronze badges\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4\n\n\n* Thanks @Ericvault it is working but I want it to open in new tab, so what changes should I make?\n\n\u2013\u00a0[Devendra Yadav](https:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/users\/15284178\/devendra-yadav \"101 reputation\")\n\nMar 15, 2023 at 15:50\n* @see above I just edited the answer.

I provide a fallback value for customdata in the example as it depends on whether you have previously set it, which might not be the case for other people landing on this post.

This methodology is included in OSINT \u2014 open source intelligence. Today, it can provide more data about a specific person than intelligence through closed intelligence service bases. How OSINT is developing, why so much attention is paid to this area in the United States, and how black PR people use leaks of personal data \u2014 [Igor S. Bederov](https:\/\/cyclowiki.org\/wiki\/%D0%98%D0%B3%D0%BE%D1%80%D1%8C_%D0%A1%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B3%D0%B5%D0%B5%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%87_%D0%91%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B2), director of the [iRozysk](https:\/\/xn----itbajbqqblqdoee3l.xn--p1ai\/) company, spoke in an interview with [Gazeta.Ru](https:\/\/www.gazeta.ru\/tech\/2024\/03\/21\/18444949.shtml).\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n**Igor, what is OSINT?**\n\nOSINT (Open-source intelligence) \u2014 intelligence using open sources of information, methods of working with open data. Although, of course, when analyzing data, we also look at closed sources, but they often give us less information. OSINT is used by law enforcement officers, security services, as well as advertisers, marketers, journalists, programmers, and data scientists.\n\n**\u2014 How long has OSINT existed?**\n\nIntelligence based on open data has existed since 1941. And it began in the United States with the Foreign Broadcast Monitoring Service to study foreign radio broadcasts. Staff recorded and translated them, and then sent information of interest to the military departments in the form of weekly reports. This service still exists today, part of the large (today there are 17 agencies) US intelligence community.\n\n\n> One of the brightest things of that period was the reconstruction of the electrification system of the USSR according to an article in the newspaper Pravda, where a scheme for the electrification of the Sverdlovsk region was published.\n> \n> \n\nThat is, based on a piece of the scheme, the United States was able to completely restore the plan for the entire electrification system of a large country.\n\n**\u2014 At what point did the turning point occur and digital OSINT became possible?**\n\nDigital OSINT was a logical consequence of the emergence of the Internet, and then social networks, blogs, forums, and marketplaces. That is, today we no longer need to study newspapers, radio and television. The emergence of the network began to radically change OSINT. He became more technically oriented, that is, he began to contact the IT field. The number of information sources has increased tens of thousands of times. It is clear that the human brain can no longer process all this, so it needs additional programs. This further connected OSINT with the IT field.\n\n**\u2014 Is OSINT legal?**\n\nIf we talk about classic OSINT, it does not imply violation of the law. And within its framework, you can only track what a person himself wanted to leave about himself on the Internet. These are geotags, check-ins, reviews of a place, comments, photographs that can be interpreted in terms of obtaining geolocation information, videos that can also be analyzed and the location of the shooting determined.\n\nAt a certain stage in the development of OSINT, new categories of data appeared. In 2014, we introduced the HTML5 Geo API \u2014 a technology that is now used throughout the Internet, on the basis of which web pages are written and browsers operate. The collection of user data has increased. That is, if previously we could determine the approximate location of a user only by his IP address, today any website with the appropriate technology can obtain the actual location of any user.\n\nWith the advent of mobile phones, Android and iOS operating systems, with the advent of mobile applications and the permissions that we give to these applications on our devices, the collection of data has increased even more.\n\n\n> Now, in addition to geolocation, IT companies gain access to our phone books, to our data storage on the device, to our call lists, to our camera or microphone \u2014 to everything that happens with our phone at any given time.\n> \n> \n\n**\u2014 Is it possible to ban this or control it somehow?**\n\nIn one of my speeches at the UN, I heard that today it is impossible to exert any influence on the uncontrolled collection of user data by IT companies. And the amount of data collected is growing and growing.\n\n**\u2014 That is, now people who use open sources can get more information than those people who use closed sources \u2014 Ministry of Internal Affairs databases and so on?**\n\nYes. Because the closed bases used by law enforcement and intelligence agencies do not involve obtaining new sources of information. They do not imply the possibility of analyzing and rethinking even the information that is collected today. That is, the Ministry of Internal Affairs maintains hundreds of different registers and GIS (state information systems), which accumulate user data. But they did not think through how this data could be compared with each other in order to obtain more information about the user.\n\n**\u2014 Do you want to say that they still drive cars and follow people, while you can sit at home at your computer and follow the tag?**\n\nYes, that\u2019s absolutely right. We ourselves, helping our colleagues, provided object monitoring services. Until 2018, this could be easily done by analyzing the codes of cellular base stations in which the mobile phone was located. Until April 2018, it cost, as far as I remember, eight kopecks. In April 2018, Russia stopped providing such information through SMS centers. Then we realized that we would have to invent something new. And they invented it.\n\n**\u2014 Six years have already passed since 2018. Have intelligence agencies started using OSINT?**\n\nS**ure.** But understanding it, of course, varies greatly from specialist to specialist. The USA is a completely different matter. They really understand the prospects for the development of this area.\n\n**\u2014 How is this expressed?**\n\nMost recently (March 8, 2024) they adopted the [concept](https:\/\/www.cia.gov\/static\/9d89dd9a4fe41b63cfab00c5191a8803\/IC-OSINT-Strategy.pdf) of developing OSINT within the US intelligence community. It says that OSINT is very important, many officials need to be trained in this, and not necessarily the security bloc \u2014 the State Department, diplomats, and so on. We need to continue cooperation with startups, technology companies, and universities. And, most importantly, great attention must be paid to OSINT specialists.\n\nIntelligence Community OSINT Strategy for 2024\u20132026As part of this work, the Americans are creating another OSINT Foundation; at the moment, in my opinion, there are already more than five of them. These are funds through which intelligence services finance the development of OSINT as a direction, promote it, and develop it in educational institutions. Therefore, In-Q-Tel and other venture funds are born, which finance the development of law enforcement startups. We don\u2019t have that.\n\n**\u2014 How far ahead of ours are US law enforcement officers in this direction?**\n\nI think about 20 years.\n\n**\u2014 \u201cThe concept also includes lines about how American officials must rethink their relationships with industry and academia to take advantage of cutting-edge opportunities.\u201d What exactly are we talking about?**\n\nThe current level of development of the information society shows that network structures work many times more efficiently than state, hierarchical structures. And therefore, Microsoft, Apple and others are more effective than states and national governments. Therefore, the United States wants to implement closer integration of the intelligence community with transnational corporations in order to use new technologies in their work.\n\n**\u2014 The concept also talks about data verifiability. What are they talking about?**\n\nData leaks, and even data published in government systems have errors. And here verification should be at the forefront.\n\nHow do all sorts of bad PR people work in Russia today, for example, with the reputation of people whom they need to denigrate? They initiate a fake leak of personal data (everyone is already used to them). Let\u2019s say this is a leak from the State Automated System of the Russian Federation \u201cJustice\u201d, and there will indeed be some parsing results. These results will include data on the prosecution of the \u201cordered\u201d person. The leak immediately spreads across hundreds of Telegram channels, and after a week it turns out to be connected to most services for verifying individuals.\n\n\n> What happens next? This person turns out to be \u201cconvicted\u201d by all sources, but it is impossible to verify this information; they believe it blindly.\n> \n> \n\nBased on it, security guards make decisions about hiring or not hiring an employee, about concluding or not concluding a transaction with the company. That\u2019s how it works.\n\n**\u2014 That is, the future lies in the same file cabinets that now exist, including those of our authorities, but only the data in them must be verified?**\n\nExactly.\n\n**\u2014 What is ADINT \u2014 a methodology that, as I understand it, is included in OSINT?**\n\nEssentially, this is modern electronic reconnaissance. Only instead of the usual transmitting device, here we receive unique identifiers that are connected through advertising profiles collected by the largest IT companies in the world. In short, we can say that ADINT (advertising intelligence) is intelligence based on advertising modules.\n\nAccording to the [concept of Paul Vines](https:\/\/adint.cs.washington.edu\/) from the University of Washington, the pioneer of ADINT (his scientific article was published in December 2017 and marked a fundamentally new approach to surveillance), we learned that by launching targeted banner advertising on the Internet, we can control the movement of any users. This happens due to the fact that banner advertising is displayed on sites that use HTML5 Geo API technology. Such banner advertising is launched through mobile applications that are capable of displaying the geolocation of users, as well as their social graph.\n\nADINT: Using Targeted Advertising for Information Gathering \u2014 Paul VinesVines\u2019 work had limited success and not everyone understood it. But then IT products began to multiply. The [ECHO](https:\/\/www.pointtrading.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2020\/07\/ECHO-Global-Virtual-SIGINT-Overview-email.pdf) service was the first to respond.\n\n**\u2014 Is he American?**\n\nNo, Israeli. They developed a second approach to ADINT. Why should we collect and pay any additional money for launching advertising campaigns, if we can simply immediately buy the data included in ADINT from their copyright holders \u2014 Google and Facebook (the owner of the Meta company is recognized as extremist in Russia and is banned)? They bought this data, and, accordingly, as part of the work of their product \u201cECHO\u201d, the user can see his movement by entering user identifiers, see his social graph, interests and everything else. This approach allows you not only to find out the necessary facts about the user, but also to make money on their resale.\n\nECHO: Global Virtual SIGINT systemWe formulated the third approach. We proposed passive data collection, but not from the device, but from geolocation.\n\n\n> We do not launch targeted advertising in the area, and wait for the user to appear in this area using the Vines method. We monitor a specific device, working with a sample of specific users.\n> \n> \n\n**\u2014 If you only use open data, then anyone in the world can track any person in the world?**\n\nYes. But to do this, he needs to have identifiers that belong to a specific user. These identifiers include your mobile phone number, email address, your device\u2019s modem address, and Apple and Google device identifiers. Here are five parameters that are loaded into the system upon input from the analyst.\n\n**\u2014 But all this is in the leaks?**\n\nIt\u2019s all in leaks, and it can be obtained in a million different ways. You connected to some Wi-Fi at the airport \u2014 it recorded your MAC address. Then you can carry out surveillance on it without even knowing your phone number. This data is constantly collected and stored in a folder.\n\n**\u2014 So, if I change my phone number, my data will go to my old folder?**\n\nExactly. Conditional Google will connect your profiles to all new devices, to all new contacts. If you log into the same account from another device, it will connect it all into one profile. If you used the same connection, for example a connection from a workplace, it will also put it all together into one profile. And just like a snowball, your profile \u201cgrows.\u201d\n\n**\u2014 It turns out that somewhere there is my \u201cdigital biography\u201d with my devices that I had before, and this is all set out in some kind of file?**\n\nAbsolutely right. And not only that, this dossier is interpreted. Your interests, requests, frequency of your movements, your approximate income, your approximate field of activity are determined.\n\n**\u2014 On February 27, the book \u201cMeans of Control: How the Hidden Alliance of Tech and Government Is Creating a New American Surveillance State\u201d was** [**published**](https:\/\/www.wired.com\/story\/how-pentagon-learned-targeted-ads-to-find-targets-and-vladimir-putin\/) **in the United States. It says that with the help of ADINT it was possible to monitor even Putin\u2019s entourage. That is, it was not Putin himself, but his staff. It turns out that we can also track Biden\u2019s movements?**\n\nYes. Moreover, when Trump supporters stormed the Capitol in Washington, I personally observed what devices were \u201crunning\u201d there. Then you could find profiles on Telegram, who it was, their photographs. So yes, it works.\n\n**\u2014 It seems that so much data is already being collected that it is impossible to collect more. This is true?**\n\nOf course not. Much more data can be collected about each user. It is for these purposes that the introduction of Web 3.0 and the next HTML6 is planned. The number of different sensors in our mobile phones is increasing and increasing. In addition to the accelerometer, retina, and fingerprint, the sensors may include some speech analyzers and facial analyzers. They can be further strengthened. Our social portrait will grow in the depths of IT companies. There are plenty of tools for this; there are no restrictions on collecting this data. So OSINT has a great future ahead of it.\n\n*Igor S.

They most usually boil down to installing surveillance devices, spyware (e.g., keyloggers), malware, stealing sensitive information or establishing a foothold to obtain remote control over internal systems. While imagination is the limit to what a bad actor can do, we know that the intentions are anything but good.\n\nPhysical social engineering attack simulations & vulnerability assessments help to proactively identify and implement realistic security measures. They evaluate an organization\u2019s effectiveness in preventing unauthorized access to its premises. They effectively assess the level of difficulty an unauthorized individual would encounter to either covertly enter the organization\u2019s premises or \u201ctalk their way in\u201d by convincing authorized individuals to provide unauthorized access to a stranger under a pretext \u2014 a social engineering scheme.\n\n***Vulnerability assessments*** *examine and\/or test a number of potential vulnerabilities found within a system (physical, digital, human, or otherwise). Their goal is to inform the organization\u2019s security strategy and provide actionable recommendations.*\n\n***Physical penetration\/intrusion tests*** *tend to examine and\/or test a number of potential vulnerabilities but then focus on a smaller number of them, build an attack simulation scenario around them, and put those vulnerabilities to the test. The end goal is to provide evidence of success or failure in a simulated attack scenario.*\n\n**RECONNAISSANCE**\n==================\n\nMost social engineering attacks that involve a component of physical intrusion start with target reconnaissance. That means collecting information on the physical perimeter of their target organization and their people. A (simulated) threat actor will look for details about both the organization\u2019s facilities and their surroundings (from geographical information to the civil infrastructure, the traffic and the roads around the facility, etc.), to security measures that are in place (badges, door types, and other systems) to insights about the building\u2019s floorplans and entry procedures. The list is long, but the more you know about a facility and its \u201crules of the land\u201d the better able you are to blend in or create an intrusion strategy that will work.\n\nAs security professionals, we can proactively follow the same process a threat actor would (through a physical penetration test or a vulnerability assessment) to identify information that exposes potential vulnerabilities in our organization\u2019s physical perimeter.\n\nThere are two main ways to collect this information during the planning & preparation phase:\n\n* **Covert surveillance**. It involves the physical presence of an individual in the proximity of a target organization\u2019s premises.\n* **Open-source intelligence (OSINT)** collection through digital sources. It can be conducted remotely and at any time.\n\nI know a few penetration testers who simply decide to show up at a facility, try a standardized scenario, and see if it works. Sometimes, they perform some covert reconnaissance beforehand. Then they show up with an \u201cI came- I saw- I conquered\u201d mentality. It gets the job done. However, this approach\u2019s success (and usefulness) depends heavily on the security maturity stage of the organization.\n\nOn top of it, as I tend to have a somewhat analytical personality, this approach does not satiate my work morale. I strongly need to dig deeper and conduct a more thorough review of the vulnerabilities that lay in plain sight \u2014 always depending on the client\u2019s needs and requirements. At the end of each engagement, I consider it necessary to provide a holistic report of the vulnerabilities found \u2014 along with risk mitigation recommendations. Overall, I prefer to offer more insights than a simple: \u201cWell, I came through the service personnel entrance, and you don\u2019t really lock your doors, so I\u2019m here now.\u201d My professional conviction is that if we want a physical penetration test to be valuable and insightful, we need a more thorough approach than just trying to be lucky.\n\nBut let\u2019s not divert.\n\nAs helpful as covert surveillance can be in identifying little nuances about your target organization (the flow of employees in and out of a building, the attention span or perceptual capabilities of a security guard, and other organizational details), it does not provide some essential information. Information that can instead be found online.\n\n**Open-Source Intelligence Resources & Techniques**\n===================================================\n\nIn this blog, I focus on some of the OSINT techniques & resources that can be used in the vulnerability assessment of an organization\u2019s physical perimeter.\n\nIn some cases, the research techniques are pretty straightforward but require viewing them with an adversarial mindset to be useful. Especially in the case of social engineering, it\u2019s often not about employing the most extraordinary OSINT tool but about being able to analyze the information we find with the right mindset.\n\nExterior\n========\n\nI usually start by looking into the big picture of our target facility.\n\n**Online Mapping Services**\n---------------------------\n\nMany of you are probably not shocked by this one. Utilizing [**Google Maps**](https:\/\/www.google.com\/maps) and [**Google Earth**](https:\/\/earth.google.com\/) belong to the very first steps I take when I look into the physical perimeter of a site.\n\nThe process goes as follows:\n\n1. Enter Google Maps and type in the address of the target facility.\n\n2. Apply the satellite layer view.\n\n3. Conduct a first visual investigation (details below).\n\n4. If available, enter the Street View mode (little yellow human icon on the bottom right of the map interface) to get a more detailed view of the environment.\n\nA similar process is applied when using Google Earth. What\u2019s different with Google Earth is that their street view is usually more detailed, they provide a 3D map viewing option, and they may have a more recent view of the site.\n\n***Note:*** *always check for the year & month of the map data you are looking at! This information is usually found within a banner at the bottom of the map. If the images you are looking at are 1\u20132 years old, you should consider that there might have been significant changes in the meantime.*\n\n**During this initial visual inspection, I usually look for:**\n\n\u00b7 The location of the main entrance and its overall construction\n\n\u00b7 The pathway\/surroundings leading to the main entrance\n\n\u00b7 Hidden entrances, especially at the back of the building along with the surroundings. Are there any doors that seem to be used by service personnel alone?\n\n\u00b7 External areas where employees seem to hang out\n\n\u00b7 The presence of a fence & the type of fence\n\n\u00b7 Potential security\/guard posts\n\n\u00b7 Parking lots & how they connect to the main building\n\n\u00b7 Adjacent facilities (e.g., company cafeteria or restaurant)\n\n\u00b7 Surveillance equipment placement (sometimes these are very visible)\n\n***Field Notes***\n\nWhy is this useful? In one case, the entire fa\u00e7ade (front part) of a building we were working on had several security measures: Guard posts, two security doors leading to the main building, and cameras. But, upon closer inspection through mapping services, we also noticed a smaller, hidden entrance at the back of the building that was not protected by any fencing and, ultimately, was leading straight into the main building. Not only was that entrance easy to access, but it was also somewhat concealed, as it was right next to a small forest in the area. As we later learned during the briefing with the client, they somehow had ignored and forgotten that entrance, left it \u201cprobably unlocked most of the time\u201d as some service personnel was regularly going in and out, and there was no camera in that area of the building and no lighting during the night. Quite literally, it was a very, very ignored (but useful) entrance. This would be an easy shortcut to the premises for a threat actor. If they decided to impersonate a service employee entering that door, it would probably not strike bypassers as something odd.\n\nIn another case, we found out that although the main building had enough security technology and processes around the main entrances, they also had an adjacent caf\u00e9\/restaurant operating under a third-party partner and catering to the employees. Taking a closer look, we could see that the cafeteria was accessible from the street. Technically, a social engineer can easily hang around in such an open environment to eavesdrop on conversations and strike up a conversation with anyone sitting nearby, especially during busy lunch hours. Making acquaintances within that group by posing as a new hire and following them back into the building is a historically successful methodology.\n\n(The images are random and provided solely for the sake of a visual example. They do not correspond to any case we have worked on or discussed in this article, or are affiliated to us in any shape or form.)Later on, by uncovering public data on their floorplans and an inside view through some public marketing videos, we also found out that the adjacent cafeteria had a connecting door to the main building with no security measures in place.\n\nThere are endless examples demonstrating how valuable mapping services have been. Still, the point is that you can gather an extensive array of information through simple, open-source services like the above to help you start discovering potential blind spots in the physical security of a target facility. Ideally, a security professional will find them before a threat actor does.\n\n\n> **Are you one of the organizations that have removed\/concealed your premises from popular mapping services?**\n> \n> The stakes are high. Your organization is probably conducting sensitive or high-value work, and you have plenty of reasons to take all the steps necessary to conceal your facility within the popular mapping services. Physical security is of the highest priority.\n> \n> You are not out of the woods yet.\n> \n> [**Mapillary**](https:\/\/www.mapillary.com\/) and [**KartaView**](https:\/\/kartaview.org\/landing)are two popular platforms that crowdsource street-view level imagery and map data and make them available to scale.\n> \n> An important aspect: since all the images are crowdsourced, they cover areas that Google Maps and Street View would never get to. We check those websites at every project to identify unedited details of importance.\n> \n> In certain instances, those images had captured personnel that was supposed to remain unidentified, entering an otherwise \u201cconcealed\u201d site. There were cars with clear plate numbers that belonged to employees working within those facilities. You never know what a bypasser will happen to capture and upload, and therefore, it is a good idea to check this very public but less-known corner of the internet.\n> \n> \n\n**Interior Spaces**\n===================\n\nWe can gather a wealth of information about the external perimeter of a site through both online and offline reconnaissance. But what about its inner areas and layout?\n\nPlenty of information can be found with the right mindset and the appropriate search queries\/ dorks. I will use Google Dorks as an example. However, the search engine you use will depend on the country your facility of interest is located in, along with some other parameters.\n\n**Floor Plans & Blueprints**\n----------------------------\n\nDifferent professionals and companies must work together to bring a building to life. On the most fundamental level, an architect and a building company will be involved in building a facility and, in many cases, an interior designer, too. These contractors are businesses that also need to develop their own project portfolios and market their services. They do so by showcasing previous work through references or case studies on their websites. These portfolios often include detailed images from the interior of a building, blueprints, and floor plans.\n\n(The images are random and provided solely for the sake of a visual example. They do not correspond to any case we have worked on or discussed in this article, or are affiliated to us in any shape or form.)A threat actor can use these details to map out how to move within a building, any potential hiding areas or emergency exits, and to build familiarity with the facility\u2019s interior. As security professionals, we do not want to offer this convenience.\n\nCheck whether these resources are available through search queries such as:\n\n*\u201cCompany Name\u201d AND \u201clocation\u201d AND \u201carchitect\u201d*\n\n*\u201cCompany Name\u201d AND (construction OR builders)*\n\n*\u201cCompany Address\u201d AND \u201cinterior design\u201d*\n\n\u2026and so on. Let your imagination run free with the combination of keywords.\n\nDon\u2019t forget to translate the keywords in the language of the country the facility is located in. In Europe, it rarely makes sense to perform these searches in English.\n\n(The images are random and provided solely for the sake of a visual example. They do not correspond to any case we have worked on or discussed in this article, or are affiliated to us in any shape or form.)Sometimes, news articles discuss the architects\/ interior designers behind specific \u201cbig\u201d projects. In these cases, you tend to readily collect the names of the contractors involved in the project and conduct searches with more specific terms.\n\n**Video Footage**\n-----------------\n\nYouTube is a search engine, too, and a particularly helpful one when looking for recent footage of the inner spaces of a target company. It is not rare for both companies or recruitment agencies to upload interviews with current employees, office tours, and demonstrate the beautiful design work within the building and the amenities offered in order to attract talent. Those videos can also be found in the recruitment page of the company. Other times, they are found in partnering recruitment agency websites. You can find them in all cases by creating relevant search queries that will bring them to the surface. You may apply those search queries either directly on YouTube\u2019s search bar, or in the search bar of your preferred search engine. Preferably both.\n\nKeywords matter. Here are a few combinations you can try out:\n\n*\u201cCompany Name\u201d AND:*\n\n*\u00b7 \u201cworking at\u201d*\n\n*\u00b7 \u201ca day in the life\u201d*\n\n*\u00b7 \u201cvlog\u201d*\n\n*\u00b7 \u201cinterview with\u201d*\n\n*\u00b7 \u201cwelcome to\u201d*\n\n*\u00b7 \u201ccompany culture\u201d*\n\n*\u00b7 \u201cmeet the\u201d\u2026 (usually refers to various work positions or people in the company)*\n\n*\u00b7 \u201coffice tour\u201d*\n\nWhen I go through these videos, I usually focus on creating a more visual context for the blueprint\/floor plan I might have gathered earlier. I also look for details that may be useful in an engagement.\n\nFor example:\n\n\u00b7 The types of doors & locks within the building\n\n\u00b7 The types of document storage cabinets & their locations\n\n\u00b7 Where the stairs & exits are located\n\n\u00b7 Whether the offices have glass walls or glass doors\n\n\u00b7 The front desk\/ entry process\n\nThe last point is particularly handy. Many videos will, at some point, show the protagonist walking from the outside and entering the building. During those few seconds, you can often clearly follow the procedure required for entry. This can include badging your way in (and the type of badge), whether there is a front desk process, the hallway, the security measures in place, etc. If you are preparing a physical intrusion, this information will likely be included in the planning of an attack.\n\nMy 2 cents of advice: if your company decides to film an interview within the premises, advise them to blur the background and avoid walking through areas that provide insights to malicious actors. Alternatively, it is recommended to skip showing the entire entry procedure or to set up the recording in lower-risk areas of the building. Still, this is not always possible. Another option could be to install more invisible security measures around the entrances or where appropriate.\n\n**OSINT Is A Never Ending Story\u2026**\n----------------------------------\n\nInitially, I wanted to include many more resources and OSINT research areas, but this blog is already too long and I don\u2019t want it to get daunting. I hope that the above tips are providing a good start. You may also read my [previous article](https:\/\/medium.com\/@christina-lekati\/corporate-osint-for-social-engineering-129d02b19d8f) for more resources on conducting OSINT for Social Engineering engagements.\n\nIf you are responsible for the physical security of your organization, a penetration tester, or a social engineer, you can make sure to check the above areas and include them in your report. The report alone can give plenty of good insights even if an attack simulation fails.\n\nI hope you picked up some good tips and that you will use them to strengthen your organization\u2019s security posture!\n\n\n> Do you need additional help or a more in-depth approach to conducting a physical security vulnerability assessment? *Feel free to connect with me on* [*LinkedIn*](https:\/\/www.linkedin.com\/in\/christina-lekati-social-engineering\/) *or* [*X\/Twitter*](https:\/\/twitter.com\/ChristinaLekati) *and let me know!*\n> \n> \n\n[Osint](https:\/\/medium.com\/tag\/osint?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849---------------osint-----------------)[Social Engineering](https:\/\/medium.com\/tag\/social-engineering?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849---------------social_engineering-----------------)[Security](https:\/\/medium.com\/tag\/security?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849---------------security-----------------)[Corporate Security](https:\/\/medium.com\/tag\/corporate-security?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849---------------corporate_security-----------------)[Surveillance](https:\/\/medium.com\/tag\/surveillance?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849---------------surveillance-----------------)--\n\n--\n\n3\n\nFollow[Written by Christina Lekati\n---------------------------](https:\/\/medium.com\/?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849--------------------------------)[485 Followers](https:\/\/medium.com\/followers?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849--------------------------------)Practicing and interconnecting my big passions: Social Engineering, Psychology, HUMINT & OSINT, for the sake of better cybersecurity & to help keep others safe.\n\nFollow[Help](https:\/\/help.medium.com\/hc\/en-us?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849--------------------------------)[Status](https:\/\/medium.statuspage.io\/?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849--------------------------------)[About](https:\/\/medium.com\/about?autoplay=1&source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849--------------------------------)[Careers](https:\/\/medium.com\/jobs-at-medium\/work-at-medium-959d1a85284e?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849--------------------------------)[Blog](https:\/\/blog.medium.com\/?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849--------------------------------)[Privacy](https:\/\/policy.medium.com\/medium-privacy-policy-f03bf92035c9?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849--------------------------------)[Terms](https:\/\/policy.medium.com\/medium-terms-of-service-9db0094a1e0f?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849--------------------------------)[Text to speech](https:\/\/speechify.com\/medium?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849--------------------------------)[Teams](https:\/\/medium.com\/business?source=post_page-----3d17f0a29849--------------------------------)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}]
